# 🎨 NEW FEATURE: CHOOSE NEX AVATAR ON SIGNUP

**Created by DEMON ALEX - CREATOR OF CHRONEX AI**

## ✅ WHAT I ADDED

I've added a **Profile Picture Selection System** to the registration page!

### 1. **Realistic Avatar System (Realism Engine V4)**
Instead of generated graphics, users can now choose from **Real High-Resolution Avatars** powered by neural filters.
Categories include:
- 👤 **Synthetics** (Real Humans)
- 💀 **Reapers** (Inverted/Dark Style)
- 💻 **Netrunners** (Hacker/Matrix Style)
- 🤖 **War Machines** (Cyber/Mech Style)

### 2. **How It Works**
1. On the **Register Page** (`index2.html`) OR **Profile Upload** (`profile-upload.html`), click **"Choose NEX Avatar"** / **"AI Avatar"**.
2. A gallery of realistic options appears.
3. Select a unit.
4. The system retrieves a **verified real avatar URL** and applies the correct class filters.
5. This image is automatically saved to the profile!

### 3. **Smart Technology**
- **Real Photos**: Uses `pravatar.cc` for high-quality real human faces.
- **Neural Filters**: CSS-based filters transform faces into Cyberpunk classes (Reapers, Hackers, etc.).
- **Lightweight**: Uses URLs instead of heavy base64 strings, improving database performance.
- **Cross-Compatible**: Works on both Registration and Profile Upload pages.
